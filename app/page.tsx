        I am a design engineer in love with tracing origins, elevating
        minimalism and embracing friction to create traditions of love and
        exploration. <br /> <br /> I study Computer Science and Fine Arts at Yale and lead the
        university's design community & studio, forming & overseeing the largest
        ever designer cohort in Design at Yale's history. I’ve previously worked
        at Kensho, S&P Global, Sea12, Fidelity Investments, and cyclio. <br /> <br /> If I’m
        not designing, you’ll probably find me supporting Arsenal (this year is
        our year), playing pickleball and tennis, taking photos, writing, and
        listening to R&B. Welcome to my home!
