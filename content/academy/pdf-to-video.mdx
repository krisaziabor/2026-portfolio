## Concept

A Python tool that converts PDF presentations into narrated video walkthroughs. Built to solve the problem of recording the same demo multiple times for different audiences.

## How it works

1. Extract slides from PDF
2. Generate voiceover script using GPT-4
3. Synthesize speech with ElevenLabs
4. Composite slides + audio into video

## Why it matters

This tool reduces a 2-hour recording and editing process down to 5 minutes of setup. Particularly useful for internal product demos and client presentations that need frequent updates.

The quality isn't perfect—synthesized voices still have that "AI" quality—but for internal use cases, the speed/quality tradeoff is worth it.
