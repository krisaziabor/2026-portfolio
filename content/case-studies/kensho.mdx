      Kensho needed a unified design system to scale their AI-powered research tools across multiple products. The challenge was creating interfaces that made complex financial data accessible without overwhelming users.

      Our approach focused on information hierarchy and progressive disclosure—showing users what they need when they need it, while keeping advanced features within reach.

      The system needed to support both rapid prototyping and production-grade implementations. We built flexible components that could adapt to different data densities and user workflows.

      Key insight: Financial analysts don't want beautiful interfaces—they want interfaces that get out of their way. Every design decision prioritized speed and clarity over aesthetics.
